= Gradle Helm Plugin
This plugin is seen here is a Fork of 'org.unbroken-dome.helm', it seems its main contributor  at the moment is not
active and personally had to make a feature implementation, I had to fork and publish, but original repository has the PR.

If the contributor became again active this plugin could be removed.

:version: 1.0.0
:pluginId: io.github.mehmetsalgar.helm

image:https://img.shields.io/gradle-plugin-portal/v/{pluginId}?versionPrefix={version}[link=https://plugins.gradle.org/plugin/{pluginId}/{version}]

This is a suite of Gradle plugins for building, publishing and managing https://www.helm.sh/[Helm] charts.

NOTE: Starting with version 1.0.0, the plugins require Helm 3.+.


== Features

* Gradle task types for common Helm CLI commands
* Build, package and publish Helm charts using a declarative Gradle DSL
* Resolve placeholders like `$\{chartVersion}` from chart source files before packaging
* Resolve dependencies between charts using Gradle artifact dependencies
* Install, upgrade and uninstall releases to/from a Kubernetes cluster


== Requirements

* Gradle 5.2 or higher
* JDK 1.8 or higher (for running Gradle)
* Helm command-line client 3.+


== Quick Start

Apply the `{pluginId}` plugin to your Gradle project:

.build.gradle
[source,groovy,subs="attributes"]
----
plugins {
    id '{pluginId}' version '{version}'
}
----

.build.gradle.kts
[source,kotlin,subs="attributes"]
----
plugins {
    id("{pluginId}") version "{version}"
}
----


Put your Helm chart sources into `src/main/helm`:

----
ðŸ“‚ (project root)
    ðŸ“‚ src
        ðŸ“‚ main
            ðŸ“‚ helm
                ðŸ“‚ templates
                    ðŸ“„ ...
                ðŸ“„ Chart.yaml
                ðŸ“„ values.yaml
----

Use the `helmPackage` task to build your chart.
